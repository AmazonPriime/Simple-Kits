# Simple Kits

Simple plugin which allows for very simple kits on a Minecraft server. These kits can be given to players via permissions and can have a delay between their usage. The items in the kits can be customised in the ```config.yml``` as well as the messages that may be produced by the plugin.

---

### Todo:
* ~~Allow for custom kits via the configuration file.~~
* ~~Command to list the available kits to the  player~~
* Timed delay between the usage of kits
* Allow for more customisability of the items in the kids: enchantments, name and lore
* Add permissions so that players can only use kits they have permission for
* Preview command that lists the contents of the kit
